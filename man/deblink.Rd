\title{NA-pad blink events / missing data}
\usage{
deblink(eyeris, extend = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{eyeris}{An object of class \code{eyeris} dervived from \code{\link[=load]{load()}}.}

\item{extend}{A number indicating the number of milliseconds to pad
forward/backward around each missing sample.}
}
\value{
An \code{eyeris} object with a new column: \code{pupil_deblink}.
}
\description{
Deblinking (a.k.a. NA-padding) of time series data. The intended use of
this method is to remove blink-related artifacts surrounding periods of
missing data. For instance, when an individual blinks, there are usually
rapid decreases followed by increases in pupil size, with a chunk of data
missing in-between these 'spike'-looking events. The deblinking procedure
here will NA-pad each missing data point by your specified number of ms.

\examples{
system.file("extdata", "assocret.asc", package = "eyeris") |>
  eyeris::load() |>
  eyeris::deblink(extend = 50)  # Bleed around blink periods just long enough to remove majority of deflections due to eyelid movements
