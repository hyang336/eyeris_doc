\title{z-score pupil timeseries data}
\usage{
zscore(eyeris)
}
\arguments{
\item{eyeris}{An object of class \code{eyeris} dervived from \code{\link[=load]{load()}}.}
}
\value{
An \code{eyeris} object with a new column in \code{timeseries}:
\verb{pupil_raw_\{...\}_z}.
}
\description{
The intended use of this method is to scale the arbitrary units of the pupil
size timeseries to have a mean of \code{0} and a standard deviation of \code{1}. This
is accomplished by mean centering the data points and then dividing them by
their standard deviation (i.e., z-scoring the data, similar to
\code{\link[base:scale]{base::scale()}}). Opting to z-score your pupil data helps with trial-level
and between-subjects analyses where arbitrary units of pupil size recorded by
the tracker do not scale across participants, and therefore make analyses
that depend on data from more than one participant difficult to interpret.
}
\details{
In general, it is common to z-score pupil data within any given
participant, and furthermore, z-score that participant's data as a function
of block number (for tasks/experiments where participants complete more than
one block of trials) to account for potential time-on-task effects across
task/experiment blocks.

As such, if you use the \code{eyeris} package as intended, you should NOT need
to specify any groups for the participant/block-level situations described
above. This is because \code{eyeris} is designed to preprocess a single block of
pupil data for a single participant, one at a time. Therefore, when you later
merge all of the preprocessed data from \code{eyeris}, each individual,
preprocessed block of data for each participant will have already been
independently scaled from the others.

Additionally, if you intend to compare mean z-scored pupil size across task
conditions, such as that for memory successes vs. memory failures, then do
NOT set your behavioral outcome (i.e., success/failure) variable as a
grouping variable within your analysis. If you do, you will consequently
obtain a mean pupil size of 0 and standard deviation of 1 within each group
(since the scaled pupil size would be calculated on the timeseries from each
outcome variable group, separately). Instead, you should compute the z-score
on the entire pupil timeseries (before epoching the data), and then split and
take the mean of the z-scored timeseries as a function of condition variable.
