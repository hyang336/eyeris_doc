\title{Z-Score pupil timeseries data}
\usage{
zscore(eyeris, groups = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{eyeris}{An object of class \code{eyeris} dervived from \code{\link[=load]{load()}}.}

\item{groups}{A list of 1 (or more) grouping variables (column names) to use
for hierarchical scaling of pupil data within each group/level specified.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector giving number of characters (code points) in each
element of the character vector. Missing string have missing length.
}
\description{
The intended use of this method is to scale the arbitrary units of the pupil
size timeseries to have a mean of \code{0} and a standard deviation of \code{1}. This
is accomplished by mean centering the data points and then dividng them by
their standard deviation (i.e., z-scoring the data, similar to
\code{\link[base:scale]{base::scale()}}). Z-scoring the pupil data is helpful for trial-level and
between-subjects analyses where arbitrary units of pupil size recorded by the
tracker do not scale across participants, and therefore make analyses that
depend on data from more than one participant difficult to interpret.
}
\details{
Additionally, you can also specify a list of grouping variables if you would
like the pupil size to be z-scored within each level of the group(s) you
specify. In general, it is common to z-score pupil data within any given
participant, and furthermore, z-score that participant's data as a function
of block number (for tasks/experiments where participants complete more than
one block of trials) to account for potential time-on-task effects across
task/experiment blocks.

Please note, if you use the \code{eyeris} package as intended, you should NOT need
to specify any groups for the participant/block-level situations described
above. This is because \code{eyeris} is designed to preprocess a single block of
pupil data for a single participant, one at a time. Therefore, when you later
merge all of the preprocessed data from \code{eyeris}, each individual block of
data for each participant will have already been independently scaled from
the others.

Additionally, if you intend to compare mean z-scored pupil size across task
conditions, such as that for memory successes vs. memory failures, then do
NOT set the behavioral outcome (i.e., success/failure) variable as a grouping
variable here within this function. If you do, you will subsequently get a
mean pupil size of 0 and standard deviation of 1 within each group (since the
scaled pupil size would be calculated on the timeseries from each outcome
group, separately). Instead, you should compute the z-score on the entire
pupil timeseries (before epoching the data), and then split and take the mean
of the timeseries as a function of condition variable.
