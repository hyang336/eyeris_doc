\title{Plot pre-processed pupil data from \code{eyeris}}
\usage{
\method{plot}{eyeris}(
  x,
  ...,
  steps = NULL,
  num_previews = NULL,
  preview_duration = NULL,
  preview_window = NULL,
  seed = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class \code{eyeris} derived from \code{\link[=load]{load()}}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to be passed to \code{plot}.}

\item{steps}{Which steps to plot; defaults to \code{all} (i.e., plot all steps).
Otherwise, pass in a vector containing the index of the step(s) you want to
plot, with index \code{1} being the original raw pupil timeseries.}

\item{num_previews}{Number of random example "epochs" to generate for
previewing the effect of each preprocessing step on the pupil timeseries.}

\item{preview_duration}{Time in seconds of each randomly selected preview.}

\item{preview_window}{The start and stop raw timestamps used to subset the
preprocessed data from each step of the \code{eyeris} workflow for visualization.
Defaults to NULL, meaning random epochs as defined by \code{num_examples} and
\code{example_duration} will be plotted. To override the random epochs, set
\code{example_timelim} here to a vector with relative start and stop times
(e.g., \code{c(5000, 6000)} to indicate the raw data from 5-6 seconds on data that
were recorded at 1000 Hz). Note, the start/stop time values indicated here
relate to the raw index position of each pupil sample from 1 to n (which
will need to be specified manually by the user depending on the sampling rate
of the recording; i.e., 5000-6000 for the epoch positioned from 5-6 seconds
after the start of the timeseries, sampled at 1000 Hz).}

\item{seed}{Random seed for current plotting session. Leave NULL to select
\code{num_previews} number of random preview "epochs" (of \code{preview_duration}) each
time. Otherwise, choose any seed-integer as you would normally select for
\code{\link[base:Random]{base::set.seed()}}, and you will be able to continue re-plotting the same
random example pupil epochs each time -- which is helpful when adjusting
parameters within and across \code{eyeris} workflow steps.}
}
\value{
No return value; iteratively plots a subset of the pupil timeseries
from each preprocessing step run.
}
\description{
S3 plotting method for objects of class \code{eyeris}. Plots a single-panel
timeseries for a subset of the pupil timeseries at each preprocessing step.
The intended use of this function is to provide a simple method for
qualitatively assessing the consequences of the preprocessing recipe and
parameters on the raw pupillary signal.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# using the default 10000 to 20000 ms time subset
plot(eyeris_data)

# using a custom time subset (i.e., 1 to 500 ms)
plot(eyeris_data, preview_window = c(1, 500))
}
