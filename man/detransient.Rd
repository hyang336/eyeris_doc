\title{Remove pupil samples that are physiologically unlikely}
\usage{
detransient(eyeris, n = 16)
}
\arguments{
\item{eyeris}{An object of class \code{eyeris} dervived from \code{\link[=load]{load()}}.}

\item{n}{A constant used to compute the median absolute deviation (MAD)
threshold.}
}
\value{
An \code{eyeris} object with a new column in \code{timeseries}:
\verb{pupil_raw_\{...\}_detransient}.
}
\description{
The intended use of this method is for removing pupil samples that emerge
more quickly than would be physiologically expected. This is accomplished by
rejecting samples that exceed a "speed"-based threshold (i.e., median
absolute deviation from sample-to-sample). This threshold is computed based
on the constant \code{n}, which defaults to the value \code{16}.
